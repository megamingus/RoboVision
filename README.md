# RoboVision ðŸ¤–
RoboVision uses face detection technology to follow a person with a robotic arm ( Mitsubishi RV-2AJ )

It's a two part project, one being an android app that is responsible for the detection and sending via UDP the position corrections needed.

The other one is a windows program responsible of communicating with the robotic arm using a serial connection.
