# RoboVision ðŸ¤–
RoboVision uses face detection tecnology to follow a person with a robotic arm ( Mitsubishi RV-2AJ )

It's a two part project, one being an android app that is responsible for the detection and sending via UDP the posision correcions needed.

The other one is a windows program responsible of comunicating with the robotic arm using a serial conenction.
